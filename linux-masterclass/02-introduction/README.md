## What happens when your start a computer?

The first thing that happens on starting a computer is that it executes the software that are there in the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) also referred to as a firmware.

This firmware comes by default in a computer stored in ROM attached to the motherboard. Secondly, it loads the bootloader which is responsible to initialize the OS.
